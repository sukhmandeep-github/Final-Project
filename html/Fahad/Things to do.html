        <h4>Casa loma</h4>
        <p>It was initially built in 1911 as a private residence—the largest in Canada at the time—for financier Sir Henry Mill Pellatt, Casa Loma (1 Austin Terrace) is now a historical museum, as well as a popular tourist spot and filming spot for movies and television.

          Visitors can explore the many impressive rooms of Casa Loma at their own pace. Walk through the great hall, or peruse any of the 10,000 books in the library on the main floor, or look at the elegant suites on the second floor. Climb up to the many narrow staircases to the top of the gothic towers (the entrances of which are located on the third floor) and marvel at the majestic views of the Toronto skyline. 
          
          Stroll around Casa Loma’s expansive grounds, covering five acres of borders, resplendent walled gardens and other botanical marvels. Visitors with green thumbs would enjoy observing the seasonal garden flora, as well as Casa Loma’s potting shed, where the estate’s collection of rare orchids and chrysanthemums are kept in the winter.

        <h4>Distillary district</h4>
      <p>Nearly 20 years ago a small group of visionary developers had a dream for Toronto.
        They looked at a derelict collection of Victorian Industrial buildings that had been pronounced a national historic site and imagined transforming it. 
        Not into another “historic district” or “pioneer village” but into something exciting and unique.
        Something the city would be proud of. They wanted to create a place that would excite and inspire the senses.
       Where people could experience new ideas, 
        new foods, new designs and new ways of living and working.</p>

        <h4>CN tower</h4>
      <p>Standing at 553 m (1,815 ft), the CN Tower   (290 Bremner Blvd.) 
        is the tallest free-standing structure in the western hemisphere and one of Toronto’s
         most popular attractions for tourists and locals of all ages alike. Whether you're looking for tickets,
          fun facts, places to eat or want to brave the Edgewalk , 
        here is all you need to know about visiting Toronto's iconic CN Tower. </p>

        <h4>Science Museum</h4>
      <p>The beautiful, attention-grabbing facade, inspired by the museum’s own gem and mineral collection,
         is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to all ROM  (100 Queens Park) has to offer. 
         The museum’s exterior, a.k.a. the Michael Lee-Chin Crystal, was quickly dubbed the 'crystal' 
         because of its crystalline shape. The structure resembles an actual crystal right on the streets of 
         Toronto! Visitors to the museum are reminded of the
         chunky geometry of a mineral up close—which they can view at the museum—as they walk through the doors of ROM. </p>
